Precalculus is intended for college-level Precalculus students. Since Precalculus courses vary from one institution to the next, we have attempted to meet the needs of as broad an audience as possible, including all of the content that might be covered in any particular course. The result is a comprehensive book that covers more ground than an instructor could likely cover in a typical one- or two-semester course; but instructors should find, almost without fail, that the topics they wish to include in their syllabus are covered in the text. Many chapters of Openstax Precalculus are suitable for other freshman and sophomore math courses such as College Algebra and Trigonometry; however, instructors of those courses might need to supplement or adjust the material. Openstax will also be releasing a College Algebra and Trigonometry title tailored to the particular scope, sequence, and pedagogy of those courses.

## About OpenStax College’s Resources   {#eip-714}

OpenStax College resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others: they can be customized by instructors for each class, they are a \"living\" resource that grows online through contributions from educators, and they are available free or for minimal cost.

## Customization   {#eip-406}

OpenStax College learning resources are designed to be customized for each course. Our textbooks provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build, and our resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind. Instructors can select the sections most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their classes and student body. Teachers are encouraged to expand on existing examples by adding unique context via geographically localized applications and topical connections.

*Precalculus* can be easily customized using our online platform (http://cnx.org/content/col11667/latest/). Simply select the content most relevant to your current semester and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of your class. Precalculus is organized as a collection of sections that can be rearranged, modified, and enhanced through localized examples or to incorporate a specific theme to your course. This customization feature will ensure that your textbook truly reflects the goals of your course.

# About *Precalculus*   {#eip-626}

*Precalculus* is intended for college-level precalculus students. Since precalculus courses vary from one institution to the next, we have attempted to meet the needs of as broad an audience as possible, including all of the content that might be covered in any particular course. The result is a comprehensive book that covers more ground than an instructor could likely cover in a typical one- or two-semester course; but instructors should find, almost without fail, that the topics they wish to include in their syllabus are covered in the text.

Many chapters of Openstax College *Precalculus* are suitable for other freshman and sophomore math courses such as College Algebra and Trigonometry; however, instructors of those courses might need to supplement or adjust the material. Openstax will also be releasing *College Algebra* and *Algebra and Trigonometry* titles tailored to the particular scope, sequence, and pedagogy of those courses.

# Coverage and Scope   {#eip-250}

*Precalculus* contains twelve chapters, roughly divided into three groups.

Chapters 1-4 discuss various types of functions, providing a foundation for the remainder of the course. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1168983371474"><span data-type="item">Chapter 1: Functions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 2: Linear Functions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 4: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</span></span>

Chapters 5-8 focus on Trigonometry. In Precalculus, we approach trigonometry by first introducing angles and the unit circle, as opposed to the right triangle approach more commonly used in College Algebra and Trigonometry courses. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id7864342"><span data-type="item">Chapter 5: Trigonometric Functions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 6: Periodic Functions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 7: Trigonometric Identities and Equations</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 8: Further Applications of Trigonometry</span></span>

Chapters 9-12 present some advanced Precalculus topics that build on topics introduced in chapters 1-8. Most Precalculus syllabi include some of the topics in these chapters, but few include all. Instructors can select material as needed from this group of chapters, since they are not cumulative. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1166690773820"> <span data-type="item">Chapter 9: Systems of Equations and Inequalities</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 10: Analytic Geometry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 11: Sequences, Probability and Counting Theory</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 12: Introduction to Calculus</span></span> All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.

# Development Overview   {#eip-350}

Openstax *Precalculus* is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors.

The first eight chapters are a derivative work, built on the foundation of *Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions*, by David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen. Chapters 9-12 were written and developed from by our expert and highly experienced [author team](#). All twelve chapters follow a new and innovative instructional design, and great care has been taken to maintain a consistent voice from cover to cover. New features have been introduced to flesh out the instruction, all of the graphics have been re-done in a more contemporary style, and much of the content has been revised, replaced, or supplemented to bring the text more in line with mainstream approaches to teaching Precalculus.

# Accuracy of the Content   {#eip-42}

We have taken great pains to ensure the validity and accuracy of this text. Each chapter’s manuscript underwent at least two rounds of review and revision by a panel of active Precalculus instructors. Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice. A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully re-working every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form. The Solutions Manual, which was written and developed after the Student Edition, has also been rigorously checked for accuracy following a process similar to that described above. Incidentally, the act of writing out solutions step-by-step served as yet another round of validation for the Answer Key in the back of the Student Edition.

In spite of the efforts described above, we acknowledge the possibility that—as with any textbook—some errata have slipped past the guards. We encourage users to report errors via our [Errata](/https://openstaxcollege.org/errata) page.

# Pedagogical Foundations and Features   {#eip-563}

## Learning Objectives   {#eip-61}

Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section, and are the focal point of every instructional element

## Narrative text   {#eip-719}

Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples. Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1166658637533"><span data-type="item">Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined</span> <span data-type="item">Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</span> <span data-type="item">Key equations, formulas, theorems, identities, etc. are assigned a number, which appears near the right margin. Occasionally the text may refer back to an equation or formula by its number. </span></span>

## Example   {#eip-802}

Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. All told, there are more than 650 Examples, or an average of about 55 per chapter.

All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we conclude with an Analysis reflecting on the broader implications of the Solution just shown.

## Figures   {#eip-236}

Openstax *Precalculus* contains more than 2000 figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

 <span data-type="media" id="preface01" data-alt="Example figure"> ![Example figure](../resources/CNX_Precalc_Figure_Preface_01.jpg) </span>## Supporting Features   {#eip-22}

Four small but important features, each marked by a distinctive icon, serve to support Examples.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1170823342101" data-alt="how-to"> ![how-to](../resources/how-to.png) </span> A “How To” is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1171996044388" data-alt="try-it"> ![try-it](../resources/try-it.png) </span>A “Try It” exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the Online version of the text, students can click an Answer link directly below the question to check their understanding. In other versions, answers to the Try-It exercises are located in the Answer Key.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1172646370884" data-alt="QA"> ![QA](../resources/QA.png) </span>A Q&amp;A may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1172406565880" data-alt="media"> ![media](../resources/media.png) </span>The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany Openstax *Precalculus*. We are deeply grateful to James Sousa for compiling his incredibly robust and excellent library of video tutorials, which he has made available to the public under a CC-BY-SA license at http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/. Most or all of the videos to which we link in our “Media” feature (plus many more) are found in the Algebra 2 and Trigonometry video libraries at the above site.

## Section Exercises   {#eip-166}

Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 5900 exercises across the 12 chapters, instructors should have plenty to choose from<span data-type="footnote" id="eip-id1167449809193">5,924 total exercises. Includes Chapter Reviews and Practice Tests.</span>.

Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id8611023"><span data-type="item">**Verbal** questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.</span> <span data-type="item">**Algebraic** problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.</span> <span data-type="item">**Graphical** problems assess students’ ability to interpret or produce a graph.</span> <span data-type="item">**Numeric** problems require the student perform calculations or computations.</span> <span data-type="item">**Technology** problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.</span> <span data-type="item">**Extensions** pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.</span> <span data-type="item">**Real-World Applications** present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences.</span></span>

## Chapter Review Features   {#eip-82}

Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1170356513666"><span data-type="item">**Key Terms** provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter. </span> <span data-type="item">**Key Equations** presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations. </span> <span data-type="item">**Key Concepts** summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant Example(s) in case students need to review.</span> <span data-type="item">**Chapter Review Exercises** include 40-80 practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.</span> <span data-type="item">**Practice Test** includes 25-50 problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter. Note that the practice test is not organized by section, and may be more heavily weighted toward cumulative objectives as opposed to the foundational objectives covered in the opening sections. </span> <span data-type="item">**Answer Key** includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises, Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.</span></span>
