<div data-type="abstract">
Precalculus is intended for college-level Precalculus students. Since Precalculus courses vary from one institution to the next, we have attempted to meet the needs of as broad an audience as possible, including all of the content that might be covered in any particular course. The result is a comprehensive book that covers more ground than an instructor could likely cover in a typical one- or two-semester course; but instructors should find, almost without fail, that the topics they wish to include in their syllabus are covered in the text. Many chapters of Openstax Precalculus are suitable for other freshman and sophomore math courses such as College Algebra and Trigonometry; however, instructors of those courses might need to supplement or adjust the material. Openstax will also be releasing a College Algebra and Trigonometry title tailored to the particular scope, sequence, and pedagogy of those courses.

#### About *Precalculus*   {#eip-626}

*Precalculus* is adaptable and designed to fit the needs of a variety of precalculus courses. It is a comprehensive text that covers more ground than a typical one- or two-semester college-level precalculus course. The content is organized by clearly-defined learning objectives, and includes worked examples that demonstrate problem-solving approaches in an accessible way.

##### Coverage and Scope   {#eip-250}

*Precalculus* contains twelve chapters, roughly divided into three groups.

Chapters 1-4 discuss various types of functions, providing a foundation for the remainder of the course.

* Chapter 1: Functions
* Chapter 2: Linear Functions
* Chapter 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions
* Chapter 4: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Chapters 5-8 focus on Trigonometry. In Precalculus, we approach trigonometry by first introducing angles and the unit circle, as opposed to the right triangle approach more commonly used in college algebra and trigonometry courses.

* Chapter 5: Trigonometric Functions
* Chapter 6: Periodic Functions
* Chapter 7: Trigonometric Identities and Equations
* Chapter 8: Further Applications of Trigonometry

Chapters 9-12 present some advanced precalculus topics that build on topics introduced in chapters 1-8. Most precalculus syllabi include some of the topics in these chapters, but few include all. Instructors can select material as needed from this group of chapters, since they are not cumulative.

* Chapter 9: Systems of Equations and Inequalities
* Chapter 10: Analytic Geometry
* Chapter 11: Sequences, Probability and Counting Theory
* Chapter 12: Introduction to Calculus

All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.

##### Development Overview   {#eip-350}

*Precalculus* is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors.

The first eight chapters are built on the foundation of *Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions* by David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen. Chapters 9-12 were written and developed from by our expert and highly experienced [author team](#). All twelve chapters follow a new and innovative instructional design, and great care has been taken to maintain a consistent voice from cover to cover. New features have been introduced to flesh out the instruction, all of the graphics have been redone in a more contemporary style, and much of the content has been revised, replaced, or supplemented to bring the text more in line with mainstream approaches to teaching precalculus.

##### Accuracy of the Content   {#eip-42}

We have taken great pains to ensure the validity and accuracy of this text. Each chapter’s manuscript underwent at least two rounds of review and revision by a panel of active precalculus instructors. Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice. A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully reworking every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form was written and developed after the Student Edition, has also been rigorously checked for accuracy following a process similar to that described above. Incidentally, the act of writing out solutions step-by-step served as yet another round of validation for the Answer Key in the back of the Student Edition.

##### Pedagogical Foundations and Features   {#eip-563}

###### Learning Objectives   {#eip-61}

Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element.

###### Narrative text   {#eip-719}

Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples. Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:

* Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.
* Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.

###### Example   {#eip-802}

Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. All told, there are more than 650 Examples, or an average of about 55 per chapter.

All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we conclude with an Analysis reflecting on the broader implications of the Solution just shown.

###### Figures   {#eip-236}

*Precalculus* contains more than 2000 figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

<span data-type="media" id="preface01" data-alt="Example figure"> ![Example figure](../resources/CNX_Precalc_Figure_Preface_01.jpg) </span>
###### Supporting Features   {#eip-22}

Four small but important features, each marked by a distinctive icon, serve to support Examples.

* <span data-type="media" id="eip-id1170823342101" data-alt="how-to"> ![how-to](../resources/how-to.png) </span> A <strong> How To</strong> is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.
* <span data-type="media" id="eip-id1171996044388" data-alt="try-it"> ![try-it](../resources/try-it.png) </span>A **Try It** exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the Online version of the text, students can click an Answer link directly below the question to check their understanding. In other versions, answers to the Try-It exercises are located in the Answer Key.
* <span data-type="media" id="eip-id1172646370884" data-alt="QA"> ![QA](../resources/QA.png) </span>A **Q&amp;A** may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.
* <span data-type="media" id="eip-id1172406565880" data-alt="media"> ![media](../resources/media.png) </span>The **Media** icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany *Precalculus*.

###### Section Exercises   {#eip-166}

Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 5900 exercises across the 12 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which to choose.

Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order:

* **Verbal** questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.
* **Algebraic** problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.
* **Graphical** problems assess students’ ability to interpret or produce a graph.
* **Numeric** problems require the student to perform calculations or computations.
* **Technology** problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.
* **Extensions** pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.
* **Real-World Applications** present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences.

###### Chapter Review Features   {#eip-82}

Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams.

* **Key Terms** provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter.
* **Key Equations** presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations.
* **Key Concepts** summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant Example(s) in case students need to review.
* **Chapter Review Exercises** include 40-80 practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.
* **Practice Test** includes 25-50 problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter. Note that the practice test is not organized by section, and may be more heavily weighted toward cumulative objectives as opposed to the foundational objectives covered in the opening sections.
